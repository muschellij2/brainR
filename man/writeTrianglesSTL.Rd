\title{Write STL triangles (without recalling the ids)}
\usage{
writeTrianglesSTL(scene, con, ascii = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{scene}{list of triangles (that have class Triangles3D)}

\item{con}{filename or connection of stl file to write}

\item{ascii}{indicator if the file should be written in
ascii or binary}
}
\value{
filename (invisible) of stl object
}
\description{
This is code extracted from \code{\link[rgl]{writeSTL}} in 
\code{rgl}.  This allows users to write the triangles in STL
without reprinting the rgl (which takes time)
}
